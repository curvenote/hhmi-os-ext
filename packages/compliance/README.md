# Compliance Extension

An extension module for the HHMI Workspace that provides tools and workflows for managing open science compliance requirements.

## Purpose

The Compliance Extension addresses the need for researchers and institutions to navigate complex open access policy requirements from HHMI, but also where applicable, NIH. It provides policy guidance, access to up to date compliance dashboards for individual Investigators and provides tools for HHMI's compliance and support staff to help ensure research publications meet open access mandates.

## Overview

The Compliance Extension integrates with the HHMI Workspace to provide:

- **Compliance Wizard**: An interactive tool that guides researchers through policy requirements by asking targeted questions about their publication plans
- **Compliance Dashboards**: Generation and sharing of compliance dashboards for individual investigators
- **Scientist Management**: Tools for examining researcher profiles and tracking compliance across publications

The extension integrates with Airtable for data management and provides a comprehensive view of compliance status across an institution's research portfolio.

## Advantages

- **Policy Guidance**: The compliance wizard helps researchers understand requirements before publication
- **Centralized Access**: Provides a single platform for accessing compliance across multiple researchers and publications
- **Dashboard Capabilities**: Generate and share compliance dashboards to support institutional reporting needs
- **Delegated Access**: Investigators can delegate access to their dashboards to their lab staff, enabling them to resolve compliance issues on the Investigator's behalf

## Use Cases

- **Navigate Policy Compliance Cases**: Track and ensure compliance with HHMI's open access publication requirements
- **Investigator Self-Service**: Enable researchers to check their own compliance status and receive guidance on meeting requirements
- **Provide Broad User Friendly Access to Live Compliance Data**: Provide a way for a diverse audience to access compliance information in a readily searchable and accessible way
